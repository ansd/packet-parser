Start the server:

```
david@nuc:~/scratch/packet-4$ erlc packet.erl && erl +S 1 +SDcpu 1 +SDio 1
Erlang/OTP 25 [erts-13.0.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:1:1] [ds:1:1:1] [async-threads:1] [jit:ns]

Eshell V13.0.1  (abort with ^G)
(search)`ser': packet:server0().
server: listening...
server: accepted
server: got stop, received 8835948 messages
```

Start the client:

```
david@nuc:~/scratch/packet-4$ erl

packet:client().
```

With a size of 5,000 the manual parsing as in server0 is much faster than in server4
